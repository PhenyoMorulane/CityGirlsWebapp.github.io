                        Internet protocols are sets of rules governing data transmission and sharing online. These ensure devices communicate effectively. Key protocols include
                       </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):</strong> Foundational protocol suite for data transport, addressing, and routing.</li>
                        <li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong> Used for sending web documents. HTTPS secures online transactions.</li>
                        <li><strong>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):</strong> Manages email sending and receiving between servers.</li>
                        <li><strong>POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3):</strong> Retrieves email from servers to local devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):</strong> Allows remote email access with server-based message management.</li>
                        <li><strong>FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</strong> Facilitates file transfers between client and server.</li>
                        <li><strong>DNS (Domain Name System):</strong> Converts domain names to IP addresses for user-friendly web access.</li>
                        <li><strong>SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):</strong> Manages and monitors network devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):</strong> Automatically assigns IP addresses and network details.</li>
                        <li><strong>ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):</strong> Conveys error and operational info about network conditions.</li>

                <h2 class="head">Web Application Architecture</h2>
                <p>Web application architecture establishes the connections between applications, middleware systems, and databases to enable seamless collaboration among multiple applications. When a user inputs a URL and initiates a request, the browser contacts the website's server to retrieve the requested page. The vital element is the code interpreted by the browser. This code guides the browser's responses to various inputs. Thus, web application architecture encompasses all components and external interactions, creating a comprehensive software system. Efficiency and specific objectives are core considerations in its design. As the predominant method of global network communication, it serves all devices and applications. It addresses concerns like size, efficiency, resilience, and security.</p>

                <h2 class="head">Client-side Engineering</h2>
                <p>Client-side engineering involves developing web application components that operate within the user's web browser. These components handle user interface design, interactions, and presentation layer control.Client-side developers use coding to create appealing, functional online applications and dynamic websites. They manage everything visible or interactive on a website, such as homepages, shopping pages, and slideshows. This work occurs on the user's device. Often known as 'front-end' programmers, they manage the user-facing aspects of web pages. Front-end developers use scripting languages like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to construct client-side code.</p>

            <section class="Server" class="bottom3">
                <h2 class="head">Server-side Engineering</h2>
                <p>Server-side engineering involves developing web application components that operate on the server, managing business logic, data storage, and client interactions. Server-side developers create and maintain the code that facilitates data exchange between the website and servers. Referred to as backend developers, they ensure the proper functioning of application servers behind the scenes. These professionals are skilled in server-side languages like Python, SQL, Ruby on Rails, PHP, and Java. They handle the functionality that enables websites to interact with databases and deliver services to users.</p>
